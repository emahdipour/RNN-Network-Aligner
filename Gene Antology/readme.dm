It is worth noting that we obtained the target alignment class from gene ontology Biogrid and the protein interaction of two pairs of species. 

We used PANTHER version 14 (Mi et al., 2019) for gene ontology.

PANTHER is abbreviation of Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships, and available on http://pantherdb.org
